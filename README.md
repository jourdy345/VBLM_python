# Variational Inference in Python
This repository contains the code for Variational Inference.
The explanation of the fundamentals of Variational Inference is [here](http://qr.ae/R4XFgB).
I guess that's all there is to say. Please let me know if there is anything wrong or something I can improve on.

# DISCLAIMER
Codes in this repository are not production codes; hence, they are definitely flawed computer-programmatically.
They are only for educational purpose and for showing that Variational Inference actually works.

## Release note
### Oct/23/2015
* Uploaded the code for Normal-Gamma model
* Will further add codes for other models
* Will convert the existing codes into wrapper functions so that they can be used as modules
